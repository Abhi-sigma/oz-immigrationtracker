# The deployed build of immiscraper
https://nostalgic-benz-2e0e2e.netlify.app/


## Features
This react app presents australia immigration invitation data in a format that is easy to use.
The project was inspired from the hard to navigate immigration website.

The data is scraped by using python.The immigration website first used static files but later on started using angular
,so my scraper failed which used beautiful soup,Hence,I had to use selenium to parse the data and then get the results.

I wanted to learn react so have used react in this project.

### one interesting that happened is since,I had the data from the old website which is not present at the immigration website,
## this website is unique since it has data from 2016 which is hard to find in structured format.
